note left: **Quality Thresholds:**\nExcellent: RTT <100ms, Loss <1%, Jitter <20ms\nGood: RTT <200ms, Loss <3%, Jitter <30ms\nFair: RTT <400ms, Loss <8%, Jitter <50ms\nPoor: RTT >400ms, Loss >8%, Jitter >50ms

note right: **Upgrade Conditions:**\n• Sustained good quality for 30s\n• Available bandwidth sufficient\n• Device capabilities adequate\n• User hasn't manually set mode
